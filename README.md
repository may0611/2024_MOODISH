# Moodish

1. Project Overview

- MOODISH is a customized application that recommends the best cooking recipes and related YouTube cooking videos based on emotions. In modern life, food is not just a means of survival, but also plays an important role in stress management and emotional transformation. However, since existing cooking recommendation systems do not consider the user's emotional state, we wanted to create an application that can provide better service by differentiating from that point.

- MOODISH recommends the best cooking using AI technology (recommendation system) when the user inputs information such as ingredients in the refrigerator, mood, cooking time, and cooking utensils. In particular, it is designed to analyze the user's emotions using FER and suggest foods that match them, allowing them to manage their emotions through cooking.

- This application provides various functions. First, it recommends cooking based on emotions, second, it manages refrigerator ingredients (image recognition or receipt text recognition), third, it stores emotional diaries and records, fourth, it provides customized recipes based on personalized data, and lastly, it recommends YouTube cooking videos analyzed by AI.

- This project aims to improve individual mental health and maximize resource utilization through food and emotional management. It also continuously learns the user's data to provide more sophisticated and customized recommendation services. MOODISH believes that this can contribute to reducing food waste, improving the quality of life of users, and transforming cooking itself into an enjoyable experience.

2. Goals and Needs

- What you want to eat changes depending on your emotions, and accordingly, you can recommend food that reflects your emotions, not just food.
- It can reduce food waste by increasing the utilization of remaining ingredients in the refrigerator. (Resource conservation)
